BluetoothActivity is an bluetooth communication app for android. This app is based off of Android Developer's open source BluetoothChat app.

Current functionality is a BT connection between the Android phone and a STM32F429 Discovery Board with an HC-05 Bluetooth Module. The App has 4 command buttons which currently as of (4/11/2015) turns on/off LEDs on the board, remote control servos, start HC-SR04 distance sensors, and an reset command for the board.
